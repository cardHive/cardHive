Application to import and analyze data of runs of card-based video games
like `Slay the Spire`

## Current State
This is a hobby project in a very early state, so don't expect anything yet... ;)

## Purpose
Main purpose of this project is learning technologies like angular, webflux and 
reactive programming.

Additionally, I like to analyze the data of games in a genre I love.
